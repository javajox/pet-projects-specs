# Implement a simple stack

## Introduction

This document contains system requirements for a simple application that implements a stack. The stack is using LIFO strategy. In order to simplify the things, the elements of stack will be simple integers.

## General description

The following operations must be supported:

- **create** - a new stack is created
- **destroy** - the given stack is destroyed and memory is cleaned
- **push** - adds a new element on top of the stack
- **pop** - this operation removes the topmost element from the stack
- **peek** - this returns the topmost element without removing it from the stack
- **is empty** - this checks if the stack has any elements
